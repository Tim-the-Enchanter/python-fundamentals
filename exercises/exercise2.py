# Exercise 2 Functions and Variables
# Part 1 - Write a function called simple():
# Assign a different message to 5 variables and print each message.

def simple():
    """Display a simple message"""
    print("Niall")
    print("Nola")
    print("Kennah")
    print("Emma")
    print("Kyndall")


simple()


# Part 2 - Write a function called simple2(). Assign a message to a variable, then print out that variable.
# Change the message and assign it to the variable again, but after the first print statement. Print
# the second message. Do these steps 2 more times. You should have 4 messages assigned to the
# same variable and 4 print functions showing the results.

def simple2():
    """Display a simple message"""
    print("Blue")
    print("Yellow")
    print("Green")
    print("Purple")


simple2()


# Part 3 - Write a function called message that takes 1 argument. Inside that function, write a print
# function that takes the argument.

def message(arg1):
    print(arg1)


message('Kids and Colors!')
