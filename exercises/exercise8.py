# Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Jaden, thank you for logging in again.

# Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
# Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are
# also in the current_users list.
# Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used.
# If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username.
# If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
# Make sure your comparison is case-insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.
# (To do this, youâ€™ll need to make a copy of current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)
