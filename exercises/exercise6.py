# 5 Write a function that takes an argument. Check this argument to see if it is a Boolean using the
# bool method. Call the method and use the below values as your argument. Using comments,
# provide the name of the argument and if it was true or false from running the code.

a = 12
b = 1.2
c = 0
d = 0.4
e = 0.0

check_if_bool1()
# check_if_bool1() prints True
check_if_bool2()
# check_if_bool2() prints True
check_if_bool3()
# check_if_bool3() prints False by default because it's a zero
check_if_bool4()
# check_if_bool4() prints True
check_if_bool5()
# check_if_bool5() prints False by default because it's a zero







# For Number 5 of this task, I say "Call the method and use the below values as your argument".
# I did not put any arguments in the lab, so use the below values. As of the time of this clarification,
# only 2 have completed and used your own, so I will grade yours separate. Everyone else should use the below values.
# 12, 1.2, 0, 0.4, 0.0
