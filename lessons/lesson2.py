# My Application Overview Lesson

# This function should be lowercase and if more than one word it
# should have an underscore to separate each word. You should have
# a parenthesis after the name followed by a colon. Statements that are
# part of the function should be 4 spaces indented.
def my_function():
    print('Hello')
    print('World')


# To run the function, you must call it by name.
my_function()


# When defining a function with arguments, those arguments go in beteween
# the parenthesis and separated by commas.
def my_other(arg1, arg2):
    print(arg1)
    print(arg2)


my_other('Red', 'Green')
